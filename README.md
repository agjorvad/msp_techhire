# MSP TechHire

MSP TechHire is an amazing program that partnered with several high-quality advanced learning programs and regional companies to train and hire a more diverse community in technology fields in the Saint Paul and Minneapolis area. MSP TechHire asked us to create a full-stack application to help track student success supported by the program from MSP TechHire's partner organizations. They also needed a way to transfer this data from their partners to the program quarterly. Finally, MSP TechHire wanted us to find a way to access the data uploaded by their partner organizations in order to show State Representatives ROI, efficient ways to access specific data for meetings, seamless ways to get data to see how they could improve the program for MSP TechHire and their partners, and quick ways to show potential sponsors how well the program is working in the community.
