## Downloading CSV files
The "Download CSV File" button on the "Search" page of the admin portal will only download data rows that are returned in the table below it. Data for all columns, not just the columns visible within the table, will be downloaded. Use the "Search" fields above to tailor your table results to the data you wish to download.  If no search is run, the "Download CSV File" button will download all student data in the database.

The "Download CSV Spreadsheet" button on the "Summary" page of the admin portal will also download all student data in the database.

## Uploading CSV files

To upload student data, click on the "Upload File" button. Navigate to the spreadsheet you use to report MSP TechHire student data and click "Open".  This spreadsheet must be a .csv file.  This can be changed in Microsoft Excel while saving your spreadsheet.
